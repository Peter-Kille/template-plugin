  <p id="about">(From Wikipedia) Eisenia fetida (older spelling: foetida), known under various common names such as redworm, brandling worm, panfish worm, trout worm, tiger worm, red wiggler worm, red Californian earthworm, etc., is a species of earthworm adapted to decaying organic material. These worms thrive in rotting vegetation, compost, and manure. They are epigean, rarely found in soil. In this trait, they resemble Lumbricus rubellus.
They have groups of bristles (called setae) on each segment that move in and out to grip nearby surfaces as the worms stretch and contract their muscles to push themselves forward or backward.
E. fetida worms are used for vermicomposting of both domestic and industrial organic waste.They are native to Europe, but have been introduced (both intentionally and unintentionally) to every other continent except Antarctica.</p>
