  <p id="about">(From Wikipedia) Aporrectodea calignosa (also known as Allolobophora similis[1] or the grey worm) is an earthworm commonly found in Great Britain. It is recognizable by the three distinct shades of colour at its front end, and it is 6 centimetres (2.4 in) in length when not moving. Its saddle pads usually form a two humped ridge across three segments along the length of the saddle, however this is not clearly visible. The worm mostly lies in non-permanent horizontal burrows in topsoil, and is rarely found in leaf litter. Like most worms, its diet consists only of soil.</p>
